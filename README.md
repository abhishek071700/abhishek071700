## 👨‍💻 About Me

Cloud Pre-Sales professional focused on AWS architecture, cost optimization, and Well-Architected best practices.  
I work on translating business requirements into secure, scalable, and cost-efficient AWS solutions, with hands-on exposure to architecture reviews, pre-sales solution design, and optimization discussions.

I focus on **architecture trade-offs**, not just service selection — balancing cost, availability, security, and performance in real-world cloud scenarios.
